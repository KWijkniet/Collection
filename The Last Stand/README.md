# The Last Stand
The Last Stand is my latest and current project. It is a multiplayer, rpg, survival game set in an apocalyptic world inspired by the audio story [we're alive](https://www.waylandproductions.com/projects/were-alive/).
All the designs are work in progress as I am not a designer.

This image shows one of the editor extensions I made to improve game management. With this tool I can set the values the player spawns with (Only when its the first time spawning).<br/>

With this tool allows me to add, remove and manage items that can be found in the game. The variables that you can modify change based on your selection. For example: if I change the type to equip able it will show me the option to add stats to the item.<br/>

**07.png**<br/>
This image shows a quest with a custom inspector. These values allow me to fully control each quest without writing any more code.

**08.png**<br/>
While developing this project I ran into a few problems and repetitive tasks. To solve these I wrote my own editor functions.
1.  Underneath the Tools/Selected I have the option to merge meshes. Everything is made using separate models in a designing scene. when this is done this option allows you to merge it into 1 mesh (or automatically multiple if the mesh is too big) and save it as a new file.
2.  There is also the option to convert to interactable (followed by a list of interactable types). In the game a designer can make a scene and turn objects into interactable objects without touching or even knowing how code works. This tool automatically modifies the object in a way that you only need to assign a very limited amount of variables to make the object work.

This image shows the first version of the visual node based editor i created to manage dialogues. This editor is created in such a way that i can reuse it for other systems as well. This image belongs with Video03.<br/>
