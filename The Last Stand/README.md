This image shows one of the editor extensions i made to improve game management. With this tool i can set the values the player spawns with (Only when its the first time spawning).

With this tool allows me to add, remove and manage items that can be found in the game. The variables that you can modify change based on your selection. For example: if i change the type to equipable it will show me the option to add stats to the item.

This image shows a quest with a custom inspector. These values allow me to fully controll each quest without writing any more code.

While developing this project i ran into a few problems and repetitive tasks. To solve these i wrote my own editor functions.
1.  Underneath the Tools/Selected i have the option to merge meshes. Everything is made using separate models in a designing scene. when this is done this option allows you to merge it into 1 mesh (or automatically multiple if the mesh is too big) and save it as a new file.
2.  There is also the option to convert to interactable (followed by a list of interactable types). In the game a designer can make a scene and turn objects into interactable objects without touching or even knowing how code works. This tool automatically modifies the object in a way that you only need to assign a very limited amount of variables to make the object work.
