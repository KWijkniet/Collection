# PopupCardboard
The Popupcardboard configurator was an in-browser configurator where you could customize your popupcardboard. A popupcardboard was a product sold by HIA3D that held your phone and had controls so you could turn your phone into a VR device for cheap. The configurator allowed users to customize, preview (with animations) and order their own popupcardboard. This was made in Unity using C# and could be used in the browser.

Since my internship ended and the ordering system was not hooked up yet the web page has since been down.
