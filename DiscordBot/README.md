# DiscordBot
I made a bot to automatically scan online stores for giveaways. To be specific it scans stores for free games. After finding free games it will post them in my discord (a chatting app) server so that everyone can claim these games. These games are all from legal sources like steam, epic games, humble bundle and more. 

**NOTE: The bot does not automatically claim games. it only notifies users. This way it does not hinder other people from being able to claim these games.**

The discord bot was originally a simple bot to format my messages to look better whenever i posted free games. This Bot recently got a make-over and got many new features such as:
1. Tracking activity (who triggers what command and what the bot is doing)
2. Automatically search for free games
3. Subscription list
4. An improved version of the previously mentioned message formatting

Im not done developing this bot since there are many more sources i would like it to keep an eye on.<br/>
