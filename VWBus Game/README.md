# VWBus Game
Volkswagen bus game was a game to promote a travelling Volkswagen bus that customers could rent and decorate with custom advertisements (perfect for promoting products at conventions). This game was made in Unity using C#. This was an AR game where users could create their own track and drive the Volkswagen around.
