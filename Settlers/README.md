# Settlers
Settlers is a project im making with my dad. Inspired by the games "The Settlers" we set out to create our own version. The current state of the project is a proof of concept. There has been little time invested in the graphics.

This image shows a test where we tested the performance of having many settlers walk around and do their own job. In the picture you have transporters, builders, wood cutters and foresters all worked at the same time. (running the game at 2x speed)<br/>
