# BenzoBeer
A client, who is a story teller and works with children with learning disabilities, has a project which needs a web developer. This project is a platform targeted to children with learning disabilities to experience audio stories using a easy to use website. This website would have a parent and child view. The parent should be able to manage the account while the child should only be able to use the intended story pages.

This project was made and published. Sadly unforseen events lead her to take down the site after a year. The images is the design chosen by the client.
