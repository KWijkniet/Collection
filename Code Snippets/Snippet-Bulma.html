                        I am a programming enthusiast with a passion for game and web development. At a young age, I wanted to learn how games worked. This rabbit hole got me into the programming world where I learned both web and game development. I have been a web developer for a living and have spent a lot of my free time recreating game mechanics. During these years of programming, I have come to love challenges, exploring new technology and creating applications more and more.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I am a team player. I have experience in working in teams through Agile and Scrum. I can easily adapt to team sizes and communicate well throughout the development process.
                        <br/><br/>
                        My dream would be to work in an international game company. Even though I wish to be a game developer I will be more than happy to become a full-stack developer.
