## [DiscordBot](https://github.com/KWijkniet/Collection/DiscordBot)
I am the owner of a small server dedicated to sharing LEGAL sources for free games. Often stores such as Steam, EpicGames, Humble Bundle and GOG host give-aways. This server has its own custom bot that scans these stores (currently automatically detects and posts free games from EpicGames). This bot is a work in progress.

## [Learning Networking](https://github.com/KWijkniet/Collection/Learning_Networking)
Learning Networking was a small project to experiment with networking for the first time in unity. This project was a test to see if i could understand and use Mirror-Networking without tutorials or extra help. The goal was to have a infinite randomly generated world. Each player would only see the area within their own cameras and the world needed to be generated on the host.
