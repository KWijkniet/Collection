# XRoof
XRoof is an indispensable website designed exclusively for roof builders. Its 
primary function is to facilitate the optimal placement of roof tiles through 
advanced calculations. By leveraging the features provided on the XRoof 
website, users can effortlessly draw rooftops with remarkable precision. 
Additionally, the platform offers an extensive selection of edge types, ensuring 
the accurate calculation of all necessary components essential for constructing 
the perfect roof.<br/>
