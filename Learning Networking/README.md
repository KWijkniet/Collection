# Learning Networking
Learning Networking was a small project to experiment with networking for the first time in unity. This project was a test to see if i could understand and use Mirror-Networking without tutorials or extra help. The goal was to have a infinite randomly generated world. Each player would only see the area within their own cameras and the world needed to be generated on the host.

## Images

This image shows 2 players inside the same world. You can also see a bit of chunk information used for both the generation and networking of the tiles.<br/>

This images shows a different version where i added objects into the world with which you could interact (chop down trees, break rocks).<br/>
